CFR

This code package is for the Corrected-Fisher-Randomization (CFR) method. This method generates random surrogate data that preserves a specified set of first and second order marginal moments of a data tensor, which makes it well equipped to be used to test for the null hypothesis that a structure in data is an epiphenomenon of these specified set of primary features of the data tensor. The randomization procedure used in CFR is based on Fisher randomization (shuffling). However, the shuffling is accompanied by a correction step that retains the primary features specified in the null hypothesis. Hence, the name of this method.
