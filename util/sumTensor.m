% This function evaluates the sum of tensor at specific dimensions
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Inputs:
%       - A: is the input n-dimesnional tensor
%       - sumDim: the dimensions to sum over.
% Outputs:
%       - sumA: an n-dimensional tensor of the sum of tensor A at the 
%       specified dimensions. The dimensions specified by sumDim will be of
%       size 1.
